 The first step within Azure is to create a "resource group" within the software. The system has dropdown prompts to choose from. The resource group should be named according to the project, this aids in keeping the resources organized and recognizable. In order to gain access into the virtual network a virtual machine was created in Azure. When building this machine the software has dropdown lists for optimal running of the  of the Virtual Machine created.

When the Machine is created the use of the machine will be held in a remote computer that will ultimately make up the Virtual Netowrk. In order to make this happen the IP Address is vital. The location of the address must be aquired and then copied. Once copied the adress needs to be input into the "Remote Desktop Finder". Once there the Remote Desktop, built by the Virtual Machine will be realized.
